# Samuel Culley Apprenticeship Portfolio
## Getting Started

Hello, this is the Portfolio Repository for Samuel Culley's Level 4 Software Developer Apprenticeship. You should start off by checking out the Overview Document in the `overview` folder, and from there it's up to you - my relevant qualifications are in the `certificates` folder, and my employer reference is in the `employer-reference` folder. 

The remaining `projects` folder contains 6 projects that I worked on, and that I think appropriately reflect some of the work that I did as an apprentice. They're numbered one to six, and this is the order that I did the work in. Some of them may refer to earlier work in another document, so reading them in order would make the most sense.
